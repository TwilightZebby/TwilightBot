# Twilight Bot

Just a small bot I made for my private server with my IRL (real-life) friends!

---
## Want to run this Bot for yourself? Here's how:

This Bot used Discord.js v12, which was in its Master branch during development of this bot.

**If Discord.js v12 is still in Master Branch, use the following to install it. OTHERWISE USE THE GUIDE ON [THIS OFFICIAL GUIDE HERE](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/)**

First, you need to install Git.
- On Windows, install from this link: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- On Ubuntu/Debian, use this command: `sudo apt-get install git`

Now we can install Discord.js v12 from the Master Branch like so by using the following command:

```npm i discordjs/discord.js```
OR
```yarn add discordjs/discord.js```

Further documentation for Discord.js Master Branch can [be found here!](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/)
